The documents here describe industry standards, conventions and best practices for writing maintainable code when working with web technologies.

Contributions are encouraged!


## Golden rule ##

**Every line of code should appear to be written by a single person, no matter the number of contributors.**


## General principles ##

+ Strictly enforce the agreed-upon style.
+ Donâ€™t try to prematurely optimize your code; keep it readable and understandable.
+ If in doubt when deciding upon a style use existing, common patterns.
