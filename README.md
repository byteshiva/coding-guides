The documents here describe industry standards, conventions and best practices for writing maintainable code when working with web technologies.

## Golden rule ##

**Every line of code should appear to be written by a single person, no matter the number of contributors.**


## General principles ##

+ Strictly enforce the agreed-upon style.
+ Donâ€™t try to prematurely optimize your code; keep it readable and understandable.
+ If in doubt when deciding upon a style use existing, common patterns.


## Editor preferences ##

Set your editor to the following settings to avoid common code inconsistencies and dirty diffs:

+ Use soft-tabs set to two spaces.
+ End lines with LF.
+ Set encoding to UTF-8.
+ Trim trailing white space on save.
+ Add new line at end of files.

Consider applying these preferences to your project's `.editorconfig` file. You can use [this one](.editorconfig) as a starting point. Learn more about [EditorConfig].
